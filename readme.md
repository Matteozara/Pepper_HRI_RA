# Pepper: HRI + RA project
This repository contains video demos and the implementation of the project for Human-Robot Interaction and Reasoning Agents developed in Choregraphe.
<br>
The code for Pepper is located inside the 'Pepper_dialog1' folder. To run it, you only need to open it with Choregraphe. 
<br>
Instead, the 'planner_lectures.py' file shows the Planner implemented in the project using Breadth First Search (BFS), and it can be run with Python3
<br>
If you just want to see the final results you can go to "Video" folder, or read the report "RA_HRI_report.pdf".
